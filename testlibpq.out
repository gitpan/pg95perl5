Creating relation person:
command = create table person (name char16, age int4, location point)

Relation person before appends:
name           age            location       

Appending to relation person:
command = insert into person values ('fred', 50, '(50,10)'::point)
command = insert into person values ('fred', 60, '(60,10)'::point)
command = insert into person values ('fred', 70, '(70,10)'::point)
command = insert into person values ('fred', 80, '(80,10)'::point)
command = insert into person values ('fred', 90, '(90,10)'::point)
command = insert into person values ('fred', 100, '(100,10)'::point)
command = insert into person values ('fred', 110, '(110,10)'::point)
command = insert into person values ('fred', 120, '(120,10)'::point)
command = insert into person values ('fred', 130, '(130,10)'::point)
command = insert into person values ('fred', 140, '(140,10)'::point)
command = insert into person values ('fred', 150, '(150,10)'::point)

Relation person after appends:
name           age            location       
fred           50             (50,10)        
fred           60             (60,10)        
fred           70             (70,10)        
fred           80             (80,10)        
fred           90             (90,10)        
fred           100            (100,10)       
fred           110            (110,10)       
fred           120            (120,10)       
fred           130            (130,10)       
fred           140            (140,10)       
fred           150            (150,10)

Removing from relation person:
command = delete from person where person.age = 50 
command = delete from person where person.age = 60 
command = delete from person where person.age = 70 
command = delete from person where person.age = 80 
command = delete from person where person.age = 90 
command = delete from person where person.age = 100 
command = delete from person where person.age = 110 
command = delete from person where person.age = 120 
command = delete from person where person.age = 130 
command = delete from person where person.age = 140 
command = delete from person where person.age = 150 

Relation person after removes:
name           age            location       
bill           21             (1,2)
